PassGen is a simple Password Generator that uses the random module to generate either one password or a list of passwords. 

Type /h to view all the commands at any time.
/exit to exit the program.
/gp (num) to simply generate a list of passwords. Typing /gp with no numbers beside it will generate 1 single password.
You may use /ap to show the 4 most used admin passwords.
 PassGen allows to hash any password into MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, or SHA512 by typing /hash (password) (hashing option)
Finally, /compass create (password) (option) allows you to create text file with a bunch of randomly generated passwords similar to a password of your choice. The options are 1 (100,000), 2 (1,000,000), 3 (3,000,000), 4 (5,000,000), 5 (10,000,000).

PassGen is a simple project and it is far from perfect but it's a beginning.
